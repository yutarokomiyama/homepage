            <p>
                Most of the applications around us are powered by electricity as an energy source. Electricity is widely
                used in modern society because it can be easily transformed in terms of amount and form, and is
                well-suited for transmission. So, how exactly do we change the amount and form of electricity? The
                practical field that deals with the technology of electrical power conversion is called power
                electronics.

                Power electronics has grown and evolved following the development of power semiconductor devices. These
                devices are one of the key components used in power converters, and their performance significantly
                affects the overall performance of the converter. Therefore, new power electronics technologies have
                been developed in response to the emergence of new power semiconductor devices. In recent years,
                high-performance power semiconductors such as Silicon Carbide (SiC) and Gallium Nitride (GaN) have
                gained attention. These semiconductors allow operation at higher power levels and higher frequencies
                than conventional devices.

                My research focuses on high-frequency power electronics using power semiconductor devices such as SiC
                and GaN. By increasing the operating frequency of power converters, passive components such as
                capacitors and inductors can be made smaller and lighter. This enables the development of compact and
                lightweight power converters that were previously unattainable.
