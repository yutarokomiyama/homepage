                    &nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the applications around us run on "electricity" as its energy
                    source. Electricity is widely used in modern society because it can easily change amount and form,
                    and is
                    suitable for transportation. The field of practical engineering that deals with the conversion of
                    electrical energy is called power electronics.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp; To date, power electronics have grown and evolved following the development of "power
                    semiconductors." Power semiconductors are one of the essential components used in power converters.
                    They determine the overall performance of the power converter. Therefore, new power electronics
                    technologies have been developed to correspond to the emergence of new power semiconductors. In
                    recent years, high-performance power semiconductors based on Silicon Carbide (SiC) and Gallium
                    Nitride (GaN) have attracted much attention. These power semiconductors can operate at higher power
                    and frequency than conventional devices.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp; My research is about high-frequency power electronics using power semiconductors such
                    as SiC and GaN. By increasing the frequency of the power converters, passive components such as
                    capacitors and inductors can be made smaller and lighter. Therefore, unprecedented compact and
                    lightweight power converters are expected to be realized in this research.
