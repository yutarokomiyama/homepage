                        &nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the applications around us are powered by "electricity" as an energy source. Electricity is widely used in modern society because it can be easily transformed in terms of amount and form, and is well-suited for transmission. So, how exactly do we change the amount and form of electricity? The practical field that deals with the technology of electrical conversion is caled power electronics.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Power electronics has grown and evolved following the development of power semiconductor devices. Power semiconductor devices are one of the key components used in power converters, and their performance significantly affects the overall performance of the converter. 
                        Therefore, new power electronics technologies have been developed to correspond to the emergence of new power semiconductor devices. In recent years, high-performance power semiconductors, such as Silicon Carbide (SiC) and Gallium Nitride (GaN) have gained attention. These power semiconductors allow operating at higher power levels and higher frequencies than conventional devices.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My research is about high-frequency power electronics using power semiconductor devices 
                        such
                        as SiC and GaN. By increasing the frequency of the power converters, passive components such as
                        capacitors and inductors can be made smaller and lighter. Therefore, unprecedented compact and
                        lightweight power converters are expected to be realized in this research.
